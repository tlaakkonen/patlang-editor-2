// useGenerateWizard has been removed. This file remains as a placeholder
// to avoid accidental import errors during a transitional refactor. The
// hook was intentionally removed because the wizard state is now managed
// by the GenerateCodeDialog component directly and we no longer persist
// the state to localStorage.

// If you want this file deleted entirely, remove this placeholder and
// delete the file from the repository.
